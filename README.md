# One-Page Portfolio Website

This is a one-page portfolio website built using React, module.css, Vite JS bundler, and various npm packages such as AOS, react-icons, scrollspy, and swiper. The website includes a header, about me section, services section, testimonials section, projects section, and contact section.

## Sections

### Header

The header section includes a navigation menu with links to the different sections of the website. The navigation menu is sticky and uses scrollspy to highlight the current active section.

### About Me

The about me section provides a brief introduction of the developer, highlighting their experience, education, and skills. The section includes a profile picture, and uses AOS to add animations as the user scrolls through the page.

### Services

The services section lists the services offered by the developer, such as web design, development, and maintenance. The section uses react-icons to display icons for each service.

### Testimonials

The testimonials section includes quotes from satisfied clients or employers, highlighting the developer's skills and work ethic. The section uses swiper to create a slider that displays each testimonial.

### Projects

The projects section showcases a selection of projects the developer has worked on. Each project includes a title, brief description, and link to view more information. The section uses useContext, useReducer, and useEffect to manage the state of the project cards, and AOS to add animations as the user scrolls through the page.

### Contact

The contact section provides a way for potential clients or collaborators to get in touch with the developer. It includes a contact form with fields for name, email, and message. The section uses useState to manage the state of the form inputs and AOS to add animations as the user scrolls through the page.
